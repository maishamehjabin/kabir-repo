            <p class="parag">Hey It's Maisha who wants to be a future programmer. This is my dream job to be a web
                developer. Just
                going
                one step further every day to become a programmer. I will not stop until I become the web development
                hero.

            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>A journey to the dream passion</h2>
            <p class="parag">When I feel a passion for something, it becomes my dream that I want to make happen. That
                feeling of
                passion is what directs you toward what you will be most happy and feel the most fulfilled doing.

                I think that separating passion from a dream takes away from the fact that passion is the feeling that
                begins that dream. The passion is the dream. There can be no dream without passion.</p>

                <p>I'm the master of HTML5 and CSS. I know how to structure a website and how to style it. Till now I
                    know
                    the basic infos about these two languages. Beyond that Im on the way and learning the other
                    important
                    tool languages as well as node,JS,react,python and many more. </p>

                <p>The best way to achieve something is starting with baby steps. without taking baby steps u can never
                    think of success without it. Its essential to go further with little foots. Always remember that a
                    sea
                    begins with a little drop of water.</p>
